# Polyglot training

## My journey to learn more programming languages

The purpose of this repository is to try solve problems with different programming languages.

I take different kinds of issues and questions, from algorithms to little projects or even small applications, and try to solve them using programming languages that I am not familiar with.

Each different language has it's own branch.

## Approach

The approach is to first analyze the problem and brake it down to its smallest components, then write pseudo-code to get to the solution.

Once there, I can start writing real code, starting with a language that i know well, then moving on to the ones that i want to learn
